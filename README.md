Convolution Neural Networks
### Folder Part A

- **train_parta.py:** This file contains the training script to train the model. We can pass various hyperparameters as input to this file as needed.
- **train_sweep.py**: This training script is dedicated to run and log sweeps in WandB
- **convolutional.py:** This file creates the convolutional neural network. According to conventions in PyTorch Lightning it also contains the training step, validation step, test step and predict step.
- **Best_Model.pth:** This file contains the parameters of the best model obtained during the sweep. Load this model to perform evaluation.

### Folder Part B
- **train_partb.py:** This file contains the training script to train the model. We can pass various hyperparameters as input to this file as needed.
- **efficientNet_v2.py**: This file downloads the efficientNet_V2_S model for training. The freezing of all layers is also done here. This file is analogous to **convolutional.py** in Part A folder.
### Common files
- The following files are common to both Part A and Part B folders.
- **dataset.py:** Loads the dataset
- **wandbConfigs.py:** Contains helper code for setting wandb configs and run/ sweep names
### Instructions to Run

- Install the following libraries if not present in your system using the command `pip install library_name`
	- PyTorch (library_name is `torch`)
	- PyTorch Lightning(library_name is `lightning`)
	- wandb
- After downloading the repository navigate to the folder which we want to run. Then the training process can be started by executing the following command in the terminal:
	- `python train_parta.py` - For Part A
	- `python train_partb.py` - For Part B
- The file will be run with the best parameters.
- The file **train_parta.py** takes a number of parameters enabling us to configure the convolutional neural network based on our requirements. The below table lists the possible configurations.

#### Evaluating the model:

- The Best_Model.pth file is present in Part A folder.
- Run `train_parta.py` with the following command: 
	- `python train_parta.py -t Y -ld Y -bp path_of_best_model_here`
